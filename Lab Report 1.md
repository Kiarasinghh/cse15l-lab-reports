`CD`


![Image](cd1.png)

Working directory : home
Nothing happened after this command was executed as it stands for change directory and no directory was given to change into. 
This is not an error as simply nothing happens.

Working directory: home 
This command moved the prompt into the lecture1 directory which can be seen with lecture1 being written after the "~/". 
This output is not an error as the `cd` command was used correctly. 

![Image](cd3.png)
Working directory: lecture1
README is a file in the lecture1 directory and not a directory itself. Therefore cd cannot be used with README as the arguement as it requires a directory. 
The output is an error for the same reason as mentioned before - a file was used as an arguement and not a directory.

`cd`


![Image](cd1.png)

Working directory : lecture1

The `cd` command brings the working directory back to home when there is no argument.

This is not an error.

Working directory: home 

This command moved the working directory into the lecture1 directory which can be seen with lecture1 being written after the "~/". This happens since lecture1 is a directory in home. 

This output is not an error as the `cd` command was used correctly.

Working directory: lecture1

README is a file in the lecture1 directory and not a directory itself. Therefore cd cannot be used with README as the arguement as it requires a directory.

The output is an error for the same reason as mentioned before - a file was used as an arguement and not a directory.

To log into ieng6 I typed the command ``ssh k6ingh@iegn6@ucsd.edu`` in the terminal. I did not need to enter my password because I had already set up my SSH keys for easy access and get logged in immedietly.

Keys pressed: ``ctr+c`` to copy the ssh url of the repository and then ``ctr+v`` to paste it after typing  ``git clone`` in the terminal.
